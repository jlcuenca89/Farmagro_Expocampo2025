            <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Our Story</h2>
            <p class="animate-on-scroll">Oryza began with a small group of scientists who saw the potential to transform agriculture through genetics. They shared a vision of a world free from hunger, where farming could be both highly productive and perfectly sustainable. They started in a modest lab, driven by a passion for discovery and a deep empathy for the challenges faced by farmers.</p>
            <p class="animate-on-scroll">Over the years, our team has grown into a global family of experts, but our founding spirit remains. We are still hands-on, working side-by-side with farmers in their fields, listening to their needs, and co-creating solutions. We believe the best innovations come from combining world-class science with local wisdom.</p>
            <p class="animate-on-scroll">Today, Oryza is more than a seed company. We are a partner to millions, a catalyst for community development, and a dedicated steward of the planet. Our story is still being written, in every successful harvest and every empowered community we serve.</p>
